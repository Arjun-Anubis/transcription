1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
As I always say, I handle the full life cycle.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,600
You know that line, right?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
I design, I implement, I ship.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,540
Well, I help design.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,420
I implement certain components.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,380
And I ship some features.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,920
The life cycle is a team thing.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,420
So when I say I handled it, I mean I handled part of it.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,500
It's cleaner to tell it like that.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,640
Shhh.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Shhh.
