00:00.000 --> 00:04.700
As I always say, I handle the full life cycle.

00:05.320 --> 00:06.600
You know that line, right?

00:07.240 --> 00:09.240
I design, I implement, I ship.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.540
Well, I help design.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.420
I implement certain components.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.380
And I ship some features.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.920
The life cycle is a team thing.

00:21.360 --> 00:26.420
So when I say I handled it, I mean I handled part of it.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.500
It's cleaner to tell it like that.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.640
Shhh.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.640
Shhh.
